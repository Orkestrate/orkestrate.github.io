		<p align="justify">Sydney, Australia, May 3, 2018 – Orkestrate Pty. (Sydney, Australia) and Flushing Iron Weld Inc. (New York, USA) today have announced an exciting partnership that enables the use of AI to improve the quality and safety for the construction industry. Combining Orkestrate’s machine learning expertise and Flushing Iron Weld’s wealth of experience in construction has delivered AI automation of quality control processes using neural network models which have been specifically trained to recognize the quality of welding at their construction sites.</p>
		</p></p>
		<p align="justify">Orkestrate have used Machine intelligence successfully in multiple sections of business, such as personalized customer service to improve loyalty and retention and predictive analytics to manage supply chain. It was a clear next step to use AI within quality control process for welding works.</p>
		</p></p>
		<p align="justify">At Flushing Iron Weld there was a huge burden for the human inspectors to determine the welding work quality. Moreover, the cost for on-site inspection was highlighted as a great opportunity to realize benefits. Another area for improvement identified was the time required to generate quality reporting metrics. This is where Orkestrate’s AI technology expertise was chosen to streamline the quality control process.</p>
		</p></p>
			
		<blockquote align="justify">"Deep learning can provide the companies with business intelligence for a better and faster decision making. Orkestrate’s AI models help reveal meaningful insights from all different types of data, such as customer data from sales, marketing, or in this case high-quality weld static from operational processes. We are excited to work with Flushing Iron Weld and their customers to build a state-of-the-art AI customized for the special needs of construction industry particularly, and any manufacturing companies in general."</blockquote>

		</p></p>
		
		<p align="justify">The neural networks were trained using a carefully curated library of digital weld photos with different welding types and qualities. The trained model was then used for assessing the quality of new welding works and generating the quality control metrics to ensure quality work. The processes are streamlined significantly with little human involvement. Flushing Iron Weld has been back testing the AI using human inspectors and confirming the AI’s accuracy is higher than 92%.</p>

		<p align="justify">After consulting with Paula Munoz/General Manager, Flushing Iron Weld partnered with Orkestrate because their technology was the best solution, it could solve current business problem. Orkestrate and its AI will allow Flushing Iron Weld to increase the speed of the quality control process, improve safety of work, reduce the labor by not being called back and excellent for training purposes as new workers will have KPI’s and metrics in their quality of welding.</p>
		</p></p>
		
		<blockquote align="justify">"We wanted to be able to improve our quality control costs using a highly accurate AI that can determine the quality of our numerous welding works many orders of magnitude faster than our current capability."</blockquote>
		<p align="right">Andres Miranda, Operations and Technology Manager of Flushing Iron Weld</p>
		</p></p>
		
		<p align="justify">The partnership would be amongst the first to apply deep learning neural networks to solve a real business problem within construction industry. This also open the gates for more R&D collaboration opportunities to many more traditional construction and manufacturing firms. Orkestrate’s goal is to work with more companies in this field to help adopt AI approach, allowing more advancement and integration of this revolutionary technology into their daily operations.</p>
