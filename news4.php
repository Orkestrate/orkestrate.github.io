		<p align="justify">Sydney, Australia, December 30, 2018 – Orkestrate Pty. (Sydney, Australia) has collaborated with Senior Designer Katie Griffin to use an AI in the fashion industry. This collaboration was successful in identifying popular floral prints released by major fashion designers at the start of the new fashion season. The goal was to increase sales and decrease waste by using AI.</p>
		</p></p>
			
		<blockquote align="justify">"Designers are pivotal to our society, fashion describes patterns with colours, shapes, and geometry, a poet also does this with words. AI can help us find new patterns which we could have never dreamt of."</blockquote>
		<p align="right">Glenn Galang, founder and CTO of Orkestrate</p>
		</p></p>
		
		<p align="justify">As a stepping stone, Orkestrate has trained its neural networks to identify what major fashion trends for floral prints are in Vogue. The model was then trained to preemptively predict what prints are desirable as shown below.</p>

		<p align="justify">This technology can be used by both the fashion label and individual fashion designers with both sides benefiting by taking an analytical approach to a subjective profession.</p>
		</p></p>
		
		<blockquote align="justify">"With customers taking a more environmentally friendly approach on all industries, reducing the amount of waste on clothes would alleviate the strain on our planet. According to Planetaid.org, The average American throws out about 82 pounds/37 kilograms of textile waste per year.  That’s 11 million tons of waste produced every year by just the United States alone. That figure is staggering."</blockquote>
		<p align="right">Andres Miranda, Director Technology Strategy</p>
		</p></p>
		
		<blockquote align="justify">"We wanted to see if the botanical and retro florals that were so prevalent on the spring/summer catwalks were still a relevant trend showing up in pre-fall 2019 collections. After running images from the pre-fall shows we achieved an accuracy from the trained AI of 96% in the identification of botanical and retro florals showing up in the pre-fall 2019 collection."</blockquote>

		<p align="justify">Deep learning proves to be very good at identifying patterns which takes years of experience. We hope that the fashion industry can utilize this emerging technology to make prints that will have a high success rate/sell.</p>
