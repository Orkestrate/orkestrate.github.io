		<p align="justify">Sydney, Australia, November 15, 2018 – Orkestrate Pty. (Sydney, Australia) has collaborated with researchers to explore the possibility of applying AI and computer vision technology in wildlife conservation field. The project has successfully trained and applied neural networks models to identify multiple tarantulas species using image classification.</p>
		</p></p>
		
		<p align="justify">Tarantulas are arthropods, which means that they are classified with other spiders, insects, and crustaceans (shrimp,crabs) in the phylum Arthropoda. Worldwide, there are approximately 850 species of tarantulas. Tarantulas occur on most of the major continents with the exception of Antarctica. Species diversity is highest in the warm, tropical climates of Central and South America, Africa, and Asia.</p>
		</p></p>
		
		<p align="justify">The scientific classification of tarantulas are not simple. Tarantulas belong to the order Araneae. The European wolf spider belongs to the family Lycosidae. It is classified as Lycosa tarentula. American tarantulas belong to the family Theraphosidae. One large species of this group is classified as Eurypelma californica.</p>
		</p></p>

		</p></p>
		
		<p align="justify">With such a complex classification with a large number of groups, it is a challenge for researchers in this field to memorise all their characteristics and correctly identify the tarantula species at first sight. The advanced computer vision and deep learning are the most suitable technology to assist researchers in this problem.</p>
		</p></p>
		<p align="justify">The neural networks were trained using a large database of tarantulas images in the wild. The database has been labeled by tarantulas researchers to ensure the quality of the model. The trained model was then used to classify the tarantulas using camera or new images with high accuracy.</p>

		<blockquote align="justify">"Caring for animals and nature will make one wealthy beyond measure. No matter how few possessions you own or how little money you have. AI technology is human-made, but it can be used to give back to the nature. I believe the AI can help wildlife conservation."</blockquote>
		<p align="right">Glenn Galang, Founder and CTO of Orkestrate</p>
		</p></p>
		
		<p align="justify">With this new project, Orkestrate and its AI can allow wildlife researchers to classify tarantulas more efficiently and continue with their study of the species’ characteristics with high confidence level. This project is a great example of how AI can be applied to natural sciences and wildlife conservation. We hope that this project will enable more R&D collaboration opportunities with other scientific research fields. Orkestrate’s mission is to help people to adopt the AI approach to improve their daily operations.</p>
