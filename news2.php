		<p align="justify">Sydney, Australia, November 3, 2018 – Orkestrate Pty. (Sydney, Australia) and Flushing Iron Weld Inc. (New York, USA) have continued their strong partnership using AI to improve worker productivity within construction. This R&D project is built upon the success of the previous quality control projects using neural networks (<a href="/news1.php">read more here</a>).</p>
		</p></p>
		
		<p align="justify">Okestrate has modelled a new AI  that can continuously monitor CCTV cameras. The AI will automatically detect and track workers on sites. It will then analyze and generate productivity reports. Orkestrate have open sourced this technology which can be downloaded <a href="/download.php">here</a>.</p>
		</p></p>
		
		<p align="justify">The neural networks were trained using different CCTV camera footage showing whether the workers were at the manufacturing line or not. The trained model was then used to detect the workers and track their movements to assess their productivity as shown in the example below.</p>

		<p align="justify">Orkestrate’s deep learning technology has a proven track record in various business applications across industries, ranging from  advanced analytics for customer relationship management  to predictive models for recommendation systems. Their latest AI has been delivered to improve quality control within construction industry (<a href="/news.php">read more here</a>).</p>
		</p></p>
		<p align="justify">Flushing Iron Weld has found that it is time consuming and costly to have their management team manually monitor the time, attendance and productivity via CCTV cameras. Orkestrate’s AI technology was chosen to help automate this task so the team can be more focused on making more strategic decisions.</p>
		</p></p>
			
		<blockquote align="justify">"One of the most important aspects in industry is to make the best quality goods possible at the lowest cost possible, paying the highest wages possible. I believe that AI technology can revolutionize all industries to achieve this goal."</blockquote>
		<p align="right">Glenn Galang, Founder and CTO of Orkestrate</p>
		</p></p>
		
		
		
		<p align="justify">With this new project, Orkestrate and its AI can allow Flushing Iron Weld to increase the speed of the manufacturing process optimization, improve worker productivity, reduce the labor cost by removing unnecessary tasks and excellent data for training and KPI study.</p>
		</p></p>
		
		<blockquote align="justify">"Worker productivity control has been a very tedious and costly task for our management team. By using Orkestrate’s AI, we can efficiently monitor our workers and keep track of the productivity report automatically for further process improvement."</blockquote>
		<p align="right">Andres Miranda, Operations and Technology Manager of Flushing Iron Weld</p>
		</p></p>
		
		<p align="justify">This project is a great example of how AI can be applied to improve the construction industry. We hope that this research will enable more R&D collaboration opportunities within various traditional construction and manufacturing industries. Orkestrate’s mission is to help people to adopt the AI approach to improve their daily operations.</p>
