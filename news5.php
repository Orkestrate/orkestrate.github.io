		<p align="justify">Sydney, Australia, February 18, 2019 – Orkestrate Pty. (Sydney, Australia) has completed an analysis on the current IT job market for graduates. This report is the result of our work.</p>
		</p></p>
		
		<blockquote align="justify">"Graduation is an inspiring time. It signifies both an ending and a beginning; it’s warm memories of the past and big dreams for the future. Don’t waste it."</blockquote>
		<p align="right">Glenn Galang, founder and CTO of Orkestrate</p>
		
		<p align="justify">The graph below shows the amount of times the keywords have appeared in the job titles from 23-01-2019 and 14-02-2019. It appears that the job market still remains strong for managers, consultants, sales and those in engineering. </p>

		<p align="justify">Below are the advertisers that are actively recruiting new hires for their customers. Proforce and Salient Group are the leaders in advertising. It would be interesting to see if advertising translates to job placements (Randstad, hit me up with some data).</p>
		</p></p>
					
		<img class="img-fluid" src="static/seek2.png" alt="" />
		</p></p>
		
		<p align="justify">Below is the number of jobs advertised per day. It seems like most of the jobs were posted during weekdays, with much higher numbers than weekends (even on Valentines day).</p>
		</p></p>
					
		<img class="img-fluid" src="static/seek3.png" alt="" />
		</p></p>
		
		<p align="justify">It looks like the trend of increasing inner city jobs continues. There are 381.06% more jobs in this location than any other part of Sydney.</p>
		</p></p>
					
		<img class="img-fluid" src="static/seek4.png" alt="" />
		</p></p>
		
		<p align="justify">More than 80% of the jobs advertised are full-time positions. I have seen this as a permanent trend for graduate hiring with most companies in the market.</p>
		</p></p>
					
		<img class="img-fluid" src="static/seek5.png" alt="" />
		</p></p>
		
		<p align="justify">There is a significant demand for labour in Healthcare and Sales with about 150% more jobs advertised than others. Human Resources, Education Engineering are the runner ups on the list. It seems like Banking and Finance are not in need of many new hires during this period.</p>
